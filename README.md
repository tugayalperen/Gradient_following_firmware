# **From Shadows to Light: A Swarm Robotics Approach with Onboard Control for Source Seeking in Constrained Environments**

[Animations of the experiments can be found in this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQXaE6NbHSe2d1Y2zXLiO3y00d4w9OrXR)
## Crazyflie Firmware  [![CI](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bitcraze/crazyflie-firmware/actions?query=workflow%3ACI)

The firmware files needed for the experiments are located in ```cf-firmware-gradient-vu/examples/app_gradient```

Please follow the official bitcraze documentation to build and flash new firmware in the crazyflie. 
More information about the app layer can be found [here](https://www.bitcraze.io/documentation/repository/crazyflie-firmware/master/userguides/app_layer/).

Once the new app is flashed in the crazyflies. Please refer to the main [mision control script] **Needs to be updated** to initiate the experiments.

## Building and Flashing
